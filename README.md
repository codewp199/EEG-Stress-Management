# EEG-Stress-Management
A real-time EEG monitoring system that detects stress using preprocessing, feature extraction (Hilbert Huang Transform), and classification (SVM). The system dynamically plays calming music tailored to EEG signals for stress reduction.

EEG signal preprocessing (noise removal, wavelet decomposition, FIR/IIR filters).

Feature extraction using Hilbert Huang Transform.

Stress classification with SVM + cross-validation.

Real-time EEG visualization + music playback integration.

Results: Achieved 88.5% accuracy in stress classification. EEG bands showed clear separation between stressed and relaxed states
